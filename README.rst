Flynn (SML version)
###################

This is a modified version of the Flynn Python library which is capable to parse
SML messages according to TR-03109. It can only decode those messages, because
no human being wants to encode such messages.

In fact it's a broken BER, which is very similar to CBOR, but I have hardcoded
the jump table as if-elif construct
